# Feature Drift

This is a project developed for UTS's subject "Research Project".

The main purpose of it is to discover novel features for new product designers.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node vesion 6 (LTS) and npm (node package manager) installed on your machine.

### Install

After you download or clone this project, you need to change into the project folder and run

```
npm install
```

in the commandline to install all dependencies.

### Usage

After you installed all dependencies, you need to run

```
node app.js
```

to start the node server. Then you can go to localhost:8000 (you may change the port if you need to) in your

browser to see the app running. 

(You may need to use a local MongoDB since my deployed app is using [mLab](https://mlab.com/) as cloud database service.

Or you will have to use your own mLab database settings.)
